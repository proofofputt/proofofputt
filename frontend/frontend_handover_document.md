# Frontend Handover Document: Backend Changes & Required Frontend Adjustments

## Overview of Recent Backend Changes

The backend application has undergone several critical updates to improve stability, data consistency, and routing. These changes primarily affect how data is retrieved and formatted, and how API requests are handled.

1.  **CORS Handling Refinement:**
    *   **Change:** Manual `OPTIONS` route handlers (`login_options`, `register_options`) in `api.py` have been removed. The backend now relies solely on the `Flask-CORS` extension for handling CORS preflight requests.
    *   **Impact:** This resolves conflicts that were causing `CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: It does not have HTTP ok status` errors. The frontend should now experience smoother CORS interactions.

2.  **Data Manager Enhancements (`data_manager.py`):**
    *   **`get_player_info` Function Added:** A new function `get_player_info(player_id)` has been added to `data_manager.py`. This function retrieves comprehensive player details (email, name, subscription status, timezone, etc.) directly from the `players` table.
    *   **`get_player_stats` & `get_sessions_for_player` Implemented:** Placeholder implementations for `get_player_stats` and `get_sessions_for_player` have been replaced with actual database queries.
    *   **Date/Time Formatting in `get_sessions_for_player`:** The `start_time` and `end_time` fields returned by `get_sessions_for_player` are now explicitly converted to ISO 8601 formatted strings (e.g., "2025-08-26T14:30:00.000Z") or `None` if the database value is null. This ensures consistent date/time data transmission.
    *   **Default Session Creation:** Logic has been added to `initialize_database()` and `register_player()` to automatically create a default "zero-stats" session for new players if no sessions exist. This prevents empty data scenarios for new users.
    *   **AI Coach Placeholders:** Placeholder functions `get_last_conversation_time` and `create_conversation` have been added for future AI Coach feature development.

3.  **API Endpoint Updates (`api.py`):**
    *   **`_create_daily_ai_chat_if_needed` Update:** This internal function now correctly calls `data_manager.get_player_info` and `data_manager.get_player_stats` to retrieve necessary player data.
    *   **New Test Route:** A simple `/test` route has been added to `api.py` to allow for basic backend reachability testing (e.g., navigating to `your-backend-url.vercel.app/test`).
    *   **Vercel Routing (`vercel.json`):** `vercel.json` has been updated with more explicit routing rules for various API endpoints (e.g., `/leagues/(.*)`, `/player/(.*)`, `/duels/(.*)`, `/notifications/(.*)`, `/players/search`, `/start-session`, `/start-calibration`). This aims to ensure Vercel correctly directs requests to `api.py`, especially for parameterized paths.

## Required Frontend Changes

The following changes are crucial for the frontend to correctly interact with the updated backend and ensure full site functionality:

1.  **Robust Date/Time Parsing:**
    *   **Problem:** The frontend was encountering `RangeError: Invalid time value` because it was attempting to create `Date` objects from `null` or improperly formatted date/time strings received from the backend.
    *   **Action:** Modify frontend code that consumes `start_time` and `end_time` (and any other date/time fields) from backend responses.
        *   **Always check for `null` or `undefined`** before attempting to parse or create `Date` objects.
        *   Utilize a robust date parsing library (e.g., `date-fns`, `moment.js`, or native `Date.parse()` with careful validation) that can handle ISO 8601 strings.
        *   Implement `try-catch` blocks or validation to gracefully handle cases where date parsing might fail, preventing UI crashes.
    *   **Example (Conceptual JavaScript):**
        ```javascript
        function parseDateSafely(dateString) {
            if (!dateString) {
                return null; // Or a default invalid date object, depending on UI needs
            }
            try {
                const date = new Date(dateString);
                return isNaN(date.getTime()) ? null : date; // Check for "Invalid Date"
            } catch (e) {
                console.error("Error parsing date string:", dateString, e);
                return null;
            }
        }

        // When consuming session data:
        // const startTime = parseDateSafely(session.start_time);
        // const endTime = parseDateSafely(session.end_time);
        ```

2.  **General API Response Error Handling:**
    *   **Problem:** Frontend was showing generic "An unexpected server error occurred" or blank screens.
    *   **Action:** Enhance global and per-component error handling for API responses.
        *   Ensure that `fetch` or `axios` calls correctly check `response.ok` or `response.status` to differentiate between successful responses and HTTP error codes.
        *   Display specific error messages from the backend (if provided in the JSON response, e.g., `response.json().error`) to the user.
        *   Implement fallback UI (e.g., "No data available," "Failed to load") instead of blank screens when data fetching fails.

3.  **Update API Endpoints (if hardcoded):**
    *   **Problem:** If any API endpoint URLs were hardcoded in the frontend, they might not align with the updated `vercel.json` routing or backend route definitions.
    *   **Action:** Verify that all frontend API calls are using the correct, updated endpoint paths (e.g., `/player/<player_id>/career-stats`, `/duels/list/<player_id>`, `/players/search`, `/notifications/<player_id>/unread_count`, `/start-session`, `/start-calibration`, `/coach/conversations`). Ensure dynamic parts of the URL (like `player_id`) are correctly interpolated.

4.  **AI Coach Feature Integration (Future):**
    *   **Problem:** The AI Coach feature is no longer automatically triggered on login.
    *   **Action:** When the AI Coach feature is to be fully implemented, the frontend will need to:
        *   Add a UI element (e.g., a button) to explicitly trigger the AI Coach insight generation.
        *   Make a `POST` request to the new `/coach/generate_insight` endpoint (once implemented in the backend) when this UI element is activated.
        *   Handle the response from this endpoint (e.g., show a "generating insight" message, then fetch and display the new conversation).

## Deployment and Testing

*   **Deploy Backend First:** Ensure all backend changes (`api.py`, `data_manager.py`, `vercel.json`) are committed and deployed to Vercel.
*   **Test Frontend:** After backend deployment, thoroughly test the frontend, focusing on:
    *   Successful login and dashboard display.
    *   "Career Stats" page displaying data (even zeros).
    *   "Duels" page displaying correctly (no pending/active duels if none exist).
    *   "Challenge a player" search functionality.
    *   "Start New Session" and "Calibrate Camera" buttons.
    *   Check browser console for any remaining errors.
