## Handover Document: Proof of Putt Vercel Deployment & Database Connectivity

**Date:** August 26, 2025
**Project:** Proof of Putt (Frontend & Backend)
**Overall Goal:** Achieve successful deployment of both frontend and backend applications on Vercel, ensuring the backend connects correctly to the Neon Tech PostgreSQL database and all core functionalities are operational.

---

### I. Current Status

The project currently consists of a frontend and a Python Flask backend, both intended for deployment on Vercel. We have been working to resolve deployment and database connectivity issues.

*   **Frontend:** Appears to be building successfully on Vercel.
*   **Backend:** Deploys on Vercel, but has been encountering runtime errors, primarily related to database connectivity and table existence.
*   **Last Action Taken:** Modified `api.py` to ensure database table initialization (`data_manager.initialize_database()`) and default user creation (`data_manager.create_default_user_if_not_exists()`) occur only once when the Flask application starts, rather than before every incoming request. This addresses a potential timing issue where database operations were attempting to access tables before they were fully created or visible.

### II. Issues Encountered & Resolutions/Actions Taken

Here's a summary of the problems encountered and the steps taken to address them:

1.  **GitHub Commit Attribution Issues:**
    *   **Problem:** Commits were being attributed to an incorrect GitHub account.
    *   **Resolution:** Instructed to clear Git credentials (e.g., via Keychain Access on macOS) and re-authenticate using `gh auth login` in the terminal.

2.  **Frontend Deployment Issues (`vite: command not found`):**
    *   **Problem:** Vercel build failed with `vite: command not found`.
    *   **Resolution:** Identified that the `package.json` file in the frontend project was missing a `build` script. The user was instructed to add a standard Vite build script (e.g., `"build": "vite build"`).

3.  **Backend Deployment Issues (Python Runtime Errors):**

    *   **`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'google.cloud.sql'`**
        *   **Problem:** The backend was attempting to import `google.cloud.sql.connector`, which was not needed for direct PostgreSQL connections via `psycopg2`.
        *   **Resolution:** Removed the `google.cloud.sql.connector` import and any related configuration from `data_manager.py`.

    *   **`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'bcrypt'`**
        *   **Problem:** The `bcrypt` library, used for password hashing, was missing from the backend's dependencies.
        *   **Resolution:** Added `bcrypt` to `requirements.txt`.

    *   **`NameError: name 'pool' is not defined`**
        *   **Problem:** The `pool` and `connector` global variables in `data_manager.py` were not consistently initialized, leading to `NameError` if `get_db_connection()` wasn't called first.
        *   **Resolution:** Ensured `pool` and `connector` were properly declared as global variables and initialized within `get_db_connection()`.

    *   **`sqlalchemy.exc.ArgumentError: Could not parse SQLAlchemy URL from given URL string` (Initial Database Connection Error)**
        *   **Problem:** SQLAlchemy could not parse the database URL, indicating an issue with the connection string format.
        *   **Resolution:** Added `psycopg2-binary` to `requirements.txt` and instructed the user to modify the `DATABASE_URL` to use the `postgresql+psycopg2://` dialect.

    *   **`psycopg2.errors.UndefinedTable: relation "players" does not exist` (Persistent Database Error)**
        *   **Problem:** Even after addressing the connection string format, the backend reported that the `players` table did not exist, preventing login and other operations. This indicated that the database initialization was not occurring or completing successfully.
        *   **Root Cause:** The `DATABASE_URL` was still being subtly misinterpreted (e.g., due to hidden characters or spaces), causing the database name to include connection parameters. Additionally, the `initialize_database()` and `create_default_user_if_not_exists()` functions were being called on every request, potentially leading to timing issues or race conditions where data operations ran before table creation was fully committed.
        *   **Action Taken:**
            *   **Emphasized Exact `DATABASE_URL`:** Provided the precise `DATABASE_URL` string, stressing the importance of no extra spaces or characters.
            *   **Refactored Initialization Logic:** Moved the calls to `data_manager.initialize_database()` and `data_manager.create_default_user_if_not_exists()` from the `@app.before_request` decorator to run once at application startup within `api.py`.

### III. Key Configuration & Environment Variables

For successful deployment and inter-project communication, ensure the following are correctly configured:

*   **Backend (`temp-pop-backend`):**
    *   **`requirements.txt`:** Must contain all necessary Python libraries:
        ```
        Flask
        SQLAlchemy
        psycopg2-binary
        bcrypt
        python-dotenv
        tenacity
        google-generativeai
        Flask-Cors
        ```
    *   **`vercel.json`:** Ensure this file is correctly configured for a Python Flask application on Vercel.
    *   **Vercel Environment Variables (set in Vercel Dashboard for the backend project):**
        *   `DATABASE_URL`: This is critical. It must be set to your Neon Tech connection string, ensuring no extra spaces or characters.
            ```
            postgresql+psycopg2://neondb_owner:npg_ndS4yXqr5Gle@ep-empty-resonance-adckmfyx-pooler.c-2.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require
            ```
        *   `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your API key for the Google Gemini AI Coach functionality.
        *   `FRONTEND_URL`: The URL of your deployed frontend application (e.g., `https://www.proofofputt.com`). This is crucial for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).

*   **Frontend (Your Frontend Project):**
    *   **`package.json`:** Must include a `build` script (e.g., `"build": "vite build"` if using Vite).
    *   **Environment Variables (set in Vercel Dashboard for the frontend project):**
        *   `VITE_BACKEND_URL` (or similar, depending on your frontend framework): This variable in your frontend code should point to the URL of your deployed Vercel backend (e.g., `https://proofofputt-backend-r4ie0nvl1-nicholas-kirwans-projects.vercel.app`).

### IV. Next Steps / Guidance

1.  **Verify Latest Backend Deployment:**
    *   Once the current Vercel build for the backend completes, **carefully check the runtime logs** for the new deployment.
    *   Look for any `psycopg2.errors.UndefinedTable` errors. If the refactoring of the initialization logic was successful, these errors should no longer appear.
    *   Also, look for log messages from `data_manager.py` indicating that `initialize_database()` and `create_default_user_if_not_exists()` ran successfully (e.g., "DATABASE_URL found. Connecting to PostgreSQL database.", "Default user 'wake@bubblewake.com' not found. Creating...", or "Default user ... found. Ensuring password hash is bcrypt compatible.").

2.  **Test Frontend-Backend Communication:**
    *   After confirming the backend is stable, access your deployed frontend application.
    *   Attempt to register a new user or log in with the default `wake@bubblewake.com` user (password: `password`).
    *   Monitor your browser's developer console for any network errors (e.g., 404s, CORS issues) and the Vercel backend logs for corresponding requests and responses.

3.  **Address Remaining Issues (if any):**
    *   **Persistent `UndefinedTable`:** If this error still appears, it indicates a deeper issue with the database connection or permissions on Neon Tech. You might need to:
        *   Double-check your Neon Tech database credentials and ensure the user has full permissions to create tables.
        *   Consider manually connecting to your Neon Tech database using a tool like `psql` or DBeaver and attempting to run the `CREATE TABLE` statements from `data_manager.py` to diagnose any specific errors.
    *   **Frontend 404 for `/api/register` (or other routes):** If the backend is stable but frontend calls still result in 404s, verify:
        *   The `VITE_BACKEND_URL` in your frontend environment variables is correct.
        *   The routes are correctly defined and exposed in `api.py`.
        *   There are no Vercel routing configurations (`vercel.json` in the root of your monorepo, if applicable) that might be interfering.
